##Recipe App
This app was created so that users may be able to capture as many recipes as they would like, as well as the steps and ingredients it takes to make those recipes. It allows you to scale the quantities of the ingredients and capture the amount of calories each recipe has in it. It gives a warning when the calories in the recipe exceed 300 calories. Users can also view specific recipes or view all recipe names in alphabetical order.

##App usage
The application is coded in C# and runs on the visual studio 2002 IDE. Once the download of Visual Studio 2022 is complete, you will need to open the project in the IDE.
